The Preprocessor
The C language uses the preprocessor to extend its power and notation. In this chapter, we present a detailed discussion of the preprocessor, including new features added by the ANSI C committee. We begin by explaining the use of #include. Then we thoroughly discuss the use of the #define macro facility. Mac- ros can be used to generate inline code that takes the place of a function call. Their use can reduce program execution time.
1. #include => header file
2. #define => MACROS
In C, the function srand(time(0)) is used to seed the random number generator to ensure that the sequence of random numbers produced by rand() is different each time the program runs. Here's a brief explanation:

srand(unsigned int seed) sets the seed for the rand() function. If the same seed is used, rand() will produce the same sequence of numbers each time.
time(0) returns the current time in seconds since the Epoch (00:00:00 UTC, January 1, 1970). Using this as a seed ensures that the seed value changes every second.
